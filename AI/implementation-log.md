# Implementation Progress Log

## Phase 1: Foundation ✅

### Environment Setup
- [x] **Created .env file** from template
- [x] **Directory structure** created: data/, models/, logs/, dagster_home/
- [x] **Python environment** validated (3.13.5)
- [x] **PYTHONPATH** configured to ./src

### Issues Identified
1. **Dependencies**: Scripts require external packages (httpx, pandas, etc.)
2. **Package Manager**: Need uv or pip for dependency installation
3. **Import Testing**: Basic imports work but need ML libraries

### Environment Status
```bash
✅ Python 3.13.5 working
✅ Project structure created
✅ Environment variables configured
❌ Dependencies not installed (expected - need package manager)
```

### Next Steps for Phase 2
1. **Install dependencies** using uv or pip
2. **Test data download** with sample data
3. **Validate data processing** pipeline
4. **Test basic ML training** workflow

## Current Todo Status
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Tech stack selection  
- [x] Environment configuration (.env, directories)
- [ ] Basic Docker setup (pending dependency installation)
- [ ] Data pipeline implementation

## Technical Notes
- Python environment is ready
- All source code syntax validated
- Configuration files properly structured
- Ready for dependency installation and testing
