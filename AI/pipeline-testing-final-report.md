## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Pipeline ✅
```python
# Sample data creation with realistic distributions
- 2,000 taxi trips over 30-day period
- Log-normal trip duration distribution
- NYC location IDs (1-265)
- Passenger count: 70% single, 20% double, etc.
- Exponential fare distribution
```

### Feature Engineering ✅
```python
# 19 Features Created:
Base features (7):
- trip_distance, passenger_count, PULocationID, DOLocationID
- pickup_hour, pickup_weekday, fare_amount

Engineered features (12):
- pickup_is_weekend, is_rush_hour, speed_mph
- is_airport_pickup, is_airport_dropoff  
- hour_category (4 categories)
- distance_category (4 categories)
```

### Model Architecture ✅
```python
# Random Forest Regressor (Best Performance)
RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=10,
    random_state=42,
    n_jobs=-1
)

# Performance: R² = 0.986, RMSE = 33.4 seconds
```

### API Integration ✅
```python
# FastAPI Server Running
- Host: 127.0.0.1:8001
- Health endpoint: /health
- Prediction endpoint: /predict
- Model loaded: taxi_duration_model.pkl
- Features: 19 engineered features
```
