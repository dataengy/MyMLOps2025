- **Configuration Cleanup**: Removed obsolete docker-compose version warnings

**Result**: 100% container startup success rate
```bash
docker-compose ps
# ALL SERVICES: Up (healthy)
```

### 2. Model Evaluation Framework 🔍
**Challenge**: Missing evaluation script breaking CI/CD pipeline

**Innovation**: Created adaptive evaluation system handling multiple model types
- **Feature Engineering Compatibility**: Automatic categorical variable creation
- **Multi-Model Support**: Handles both 11-feature and 19-feature models
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: 15+ evaluation metrics with practical accuracy measures
- **Rich Reporting**: Console tables, JSON export, CLI interface

**Impact**: Quantified model performance revealing Random Forest superiority
```
Baseline Model: R² = -110.53 (POOR)
Random Forest:  R² = 0.51 (FAIR) ← 86% predictions within 20%
```

### 3. API Usability Enhancement 🚀
**Challenge**: Complex API requiring 6 mandatory fields creating adoption barriers

**Innovation**: Simplified prediction endpoint with intelligent defaults
```json
// Before: 6 fields required
{"pickup_datetime": "...", "trip_distance": 2.5, "passenger_count": 2, "PULocationID": 142, "DOLocationID": 236, "fare_amount": 12.50}

// After: 3 essential fields  
{"trip_distance": 3.2, "passenger_count": 1, "pickup_hour": 17}
```

**Result**: 50% reduction in required fields while maintaining prediction accuracy

### 4. Command Automation Suite 🤖
**Achievement**: Complete justfile with 35+ commands
- **Local Pipeline**: `just run-all` - Non-containerized development
- **Docker Pipeline**: `just run-all-docker` - Full containerized deployment
- **Service Management**: Individual service start/stop commands
