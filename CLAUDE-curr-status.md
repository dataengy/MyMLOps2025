# Current Project Status - MLOps NYTaxi

## Last 3 Finished Tasks
1. **Project Structure Setup** - Created directory structure with AI/, src/, tests/, data/, docs/, scripts/ 
2. **Tech Stack Selection** - Chose Dagster, DuckDB, MLflow, scikit-learn for simplicity and effectiveness
3. **Documentation Foundation** - Created CLAUDE.md, TODO.md, and technical plan in AI/

## Started but Not Finished Tasks
- **Environment Configuration** - Need pyproject.toml, requirements, and .env setup
- **Docker Setup** - Basic containerization for development environment
- **Data Pipeline** - NYC taxi data download and processing scripts

## Current Proposal: Next Steps
1. **Create Python environment configuration** with uv and pyproject.toml
2. **Implement data download script** for NYC taxi PARQUET files
3. **Set up DuckDB data processing** pipeline with basic feature engineering
4. **Initialize MLflow** for experiment tracking
5. **Create baseline scikit-learn model** for trip duration prediction

## Project Goal
End-to-end MLOps pipeline for NYC taxi trip duration prediction demonstrating modern ML engineering practices with experiment tracking, automated deployment, and monitoring.

**Selected ML Task**: Predict trip duration using pickup/dropoff locations, times, distances, and trip characteristics.
